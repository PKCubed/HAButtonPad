# HAButtonPad
A board of buttons for Home Assistant

## Features I Want to Add
- Unlimitted number of switches and scenes
- Display switch names on screen when touching but not pressing the button using capacitive touch. Make a ring of wire around each button and use the ESP32's touch pins to detect the presense of a finger.
